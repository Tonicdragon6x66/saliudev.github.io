Well. Finally got around to putting this website together. Thanks to [Hank Quinlan's](https://github.com/hankquinlan/hankquinlan.github.io) template. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
