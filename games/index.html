                        Alien Rescue (AR) is an online problem-based 3D immersive learning environment for sixth grade science, which is created by using React + Firebase + Blender. It combines best practices from educational research with innovative technologies to deliver an engaging learning experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
I joined Alien Rescue (AR) team as a researcher, programmer, designer since Spring 2013. Although AR is not open for general public, but you can download and check out the period table I created for AR.

                            Pivot is a first person control strategy game, which was made during 2014 Rooster Teeth Game JAM (Theme: Sound without sight, sight without sight, btw we won the BEST IN SHOW). It is an open world 3D environment and created in Unity. Player needs to escape from this horrify place by using either sight (firefly) or sound (dog barking). I worked as a UI designer and programmer in the team. PS: you don't have to be a great programmer to make a great game. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/5uw66vau03dlhns/Pivot%201.0.zip">Download</a>

                            Salamander Rescue (SR) teaches 6th grade science students about biology, ecology and the environment, and gives them an opportunity to conduct scientific inquiry and practice problem solving skills in a fun, immersive 3D environment. Much like <a href="https://alienrescue.education.utexas.edu/">Alien Rescue (AR)</a>, it is non-linear and problem-based: the students solve an ill-defined problem within an open-ended virtual world.
